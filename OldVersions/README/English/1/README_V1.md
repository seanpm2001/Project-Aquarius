# Project Aquarius

Project Aquarius is a hub for software and digital works (such as books, images, videos, and other media) in the field of Marine Biology. The project is named after the 11th Astrological Zodiac Sign (♒︎) which was brought up after naming the second project (AquariOS) as I originally didn't notice the similarity.
